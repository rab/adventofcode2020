# --- Day 11: Seating System ---

# Your plane lands with plenty of time to spare. The final leg of your journey is a ferry that
# goes directly to the tropical island where you can finally start your vacation. As you reach the
# waiting area to board the ferry, you realize you're so early, nobody else has even arrived yet!
#
# By modeling the process people use to choose (or abandon) their seat in the waiting area, you're
# pretty sure you can predict the best place to sit. You make a quick map of the seat layout (your
# puzzle input).
#
# The seat layout fits neatly on a grid. Each position is either floor (.), an empty seat (L), or
# an occupied seat (#). For example, the initial seat layout might look like this:
#
# L.LL.LL.LL
# LLLLLLL.LL
# L.L.L..L..
# LLLL.LL.LL
# L.LL.LL.LL
# L.LLLLL.LL
# ..L.L.....
# LLLLLLLLLL
# L.LLLLLL.L
# L.LLLLL.LL
#
# Now, you just need to model the people who will be arriving shortly. Fortunately, people are
# entirely predictable and always follow a simple set of rules. All decisions are based on the
# number of occupied seats adjacent to a given seat (one of the eight positions immediately up,
# down, left, right, or diagonal from the seat). The following rules are applied to every seat
# simultaneously:
#
#
# If a seat is empty (L) and there are no occupied seats adjacent to it, the seat becomes occupied.
# If a seat is occupied (#) and four or more seats adjacent to it are also occupied, the seat becomes empty.
# Otherwise, the seat's state does not change.
#
# Floor (.) never changes; seats don't move, and nobody sits on the floor.
#
# After one round of these rules, every seat in the example layout becomes occupied:
#
# #.##.##.##
# #######.##
# #.#.#..#..
# ####.##.##
# #.##.##.##
# #.#####.##
# ..#.#.....
# ##########
# #.######.#
# #.#####.##
#
# After a second round, the seats with four or more occupied adjacent seats become empty again:
#
# #.LL.L#.##
# #LLLLLL.L#
# L.L.L..L..
# #LLL.LL.L#
# #.LL.LL.LL
# #.LLLL#.##
# ..L.L.....
# #LLLLLLLL#
# #.LLLLLL.L
# #.#LLLL.##
#
# This process continues for three more rounds:
#
# #.##.L#.##
# #L###LL.L#
# L.#.#..#..
# #L##.##.L#
# #.##.LL.LL
# #.###L#.##
# ..#.#.....
# #L######L#
# #.LL###L.L
# #.#L###.##
#
# #.#L.L#.##
# #LLL#LL.L#
# L.L.L..#..
# #LLL.##.L#
# #.LL.LL.LL
# #.LL#L#.##
# ..L.L.....
# #L#LLLL#L#
# #.LLLLLL.L
# #.#L#L#.##
#
# #.#L.L#.##
# #LLL#LL.L#
# L.#.L..#..
# #L##.##.L#
# #.#L.LL.LL
# #.#L#L#.##
# ..L.L.....
# #L#L##L#L#
# #.LLLLLL.L
# #.#L#L#.##
#
# At this point, something interesting happens: the chaos stabilizes and further applications of
# these rules cause no seats to change state! Once people stop moving around, you count 37
# occupied seats.
#
# Simulate your seating area by applying the seating rules repeatedly until no seats change
# state. How many seats end up occupied?

# --- Part Two ---

# As soon as people start to arrive, you realize your mistake. People don't just care about
# adjacent seats - they care about the first seat they can see in each of those eight directions!

# Now, instead of considering just the eight immediately adjacent seats, consider the first seat
# in each of those eight directions. For example, the empty seat below would see eight occupied
# seats:

# .......#.
# ...#.....
# .#.......
# .........
# ..#L....#
# ....#....
# .........
# #........
# ...#.....

# The leftmost empty seat below would only see one empty seat, but cannot see any of the occupied
# ones:

# .............
# .L.L.#.#.#.#.
# .............

# The empty seat below would see no occupied seats:

# .##.##.
# #.#.#.#
# ##...##
# ...L...
# ##...##
# #.#.#.#
# .##.##.

# Also, people seem to be more tolerant than you expected: it now takes five or more visible
# occupied seats for an occupied seat to become empty (rather than four or more from the previous
# rules). The other rules still apply: empty seats that see no occupied seats become occupied,
# seats matching no rule don't change, and floor never changes.

# Given the same starting layout as above, these new rules cause the seating area to shift around as follows:

# L.LL.LL.LL
# LLLLLLL.LL
# L.L.L..L..
# LLLL.LL.LL
# L.LL.LL.LL
# L.LLLLL.LL
# ..L.L.....
